UADetector
==========

Fork of UADetector to add newly discoverd regex to the UA string datastore.

Clone and test:
```
git clone https://github.com/50onRed/uadetector.git
cd uadetector/examples/helloworld/
mvn clean package jetty:run
```
Then connect with a browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) or mock a UA string with curl:
```
curl -A "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/42.0.2311.135 Safari/537.36 Edge/12.10240" http://localhost:8080/
```

The UA string datastore is in `/uadetector-resources/src/main/resources/net/sf/uadetector/resources/uas.xml`.  It's structure is:
```
uasdata
  data
    robots
    operating_systems
    browsers
    browser_types
    browsers_reg
    browsers_os
    operating_systems_reg
    devices
    devices_reg
```

What is UADetector?
-----

UADetector is a library to identify over 190 different desktop and mobile
browsers and 130 other User-Agents like feed readers, email clients and
multimedia players. In addition, even more than 400 robots like BingBot,
Googlebot or Yahoo Bot can be identified.

This library is a free, portable Java library to analyze User-Agent strings.
The goal of this library is to detect the type and the associated operating
system of a client like `Mobile Firefox 9.0` on `Android` or `Mobile
Safari 5.1` on `iOS`.

UADetector is divided into two modules. The core module includes
the API and implementation to read the detection information and the functions
to identify User-Agents. The resources module contains the database with the
necessary identification information and a service factory class to get simply
preconfigured UserAgentStringParser singletons. This library will be published
monthly, is integration-tested against the core module and is guaranteed to run
against the defined core.


Device categorization
-----

Since version `0.9.10` we support device categorization which means that for
instance an *iPhone* or *Nexus 4* will be classified as "Smartphone" and an
*iPad*, *Kindle* or *Surface RT* as "Tablet". Please take a look into our
[API documentation](http://uadetector.sourceforge.net/modules/uadetector-core/apidocs/net/sf/uadetector/ReadableUserAgent.html)
to get an idea what you can get when parsing an user agent string.


Features
--------

### Detects over 190 different browsers

This library detects over 190 different desktop and mobile browsers and 130
other User-Agents like feed readers, multimedia players and email clients.

### Identifies over 400 robots

In the Internet many robots are on their way to examine sites. A large number
of robots can be detected with this library.

### Monthly updated

Each month a new version of the resources module will be published so you can
always detect the latest User-Agents.

### Extremely tested

All classes in this library have been especially tested. The unit tests have
over 90% branch coverage and 98% line coverage. In addition, many integration
tests performed regularly.
