   Depending on the load of remote Maven repositories, you may have 
   to run "mvn clean package" several times until the required dependencies are 
   all located in your local maven repository. It usually takes some time for 
   maven to download required dependencies in the first build.

3) The distributions will be available under "distribution/target" directory.
